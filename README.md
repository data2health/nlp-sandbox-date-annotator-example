An example implementation of the [NLP Sandbox Date Annotator].

## Specification

- Implements the [NLP Sandbox Date Annotator OpenAPI specification]
- Annotates date strings in clinical notes using simple regular expressions

## Usage

[![Gitpod](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gitpod-Open_in_Gitpod-blue?color=0273b3&labelColor=555555&logoColor=ffffff&style=for-the-badge&logo=gitpod&label=)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/nlpsandbox/date-annotator-example)

### Running with Docker

The command below starts the Date Annotator locally.

    docker-compose up

### Running with Python

We recommend using a Conda environment to install and run the Date Annotator.

    conda create --name nlp-sandbox-date-annotator-example python=3.8.5
    conda activate nlp-sandbox-date-annotator-example

Install and start the Date Annotator.

    cd server/
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    cd server && python -m openapi_server

## Annotating clinical notes

When running, the Date Annotator provides a web interface (http://localhost:8080/api/v1/ui/)
that you can use to explore the input, output and actions available.

## Evaluating performance in the NLP Sandbox

Requirements:

- The NLP Sandbox requires NLP Tools to be dockerized
- The dockerized tool must be standalone and not depends on access to the
  Internet. This requirement contributes to make the tool more reproducible.

## Development

This section describes how you can start developing your own Date Annotator that
you can then submit for evaluation to the NLP Sandbox.

### Requirements

- [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/)
- Java (required by [OpenAPITools/openapi-generator])

### Start developing your own server

One option is to [create a GitHub repository based on this template repository][create_gh_repo_from_template]
if you plan to write your code in Python. This repository comes with a GitHub
workflow that will help you implementing good practices and notify you when a
new version of the OpenAPI specification for this NLP Tool is available. The
GitHub workfow also includes a job to automatically submit your Date Annotator
to the NLP Sandbox for evaluation.

Alternatively, follow the steps listed below to generate an initial implementation
of the Date Annotator using one of the many languages and framework supported by
[OpenAPITools/openapi-generator].

Start by downloading the latest version of the [NLP Sandbox Date Annotator OpenAPI specification]
and save this file to the root folder of your project.

    curl -f -O https://sage-bionetworks.github.io/nlp-sandbox-schemas/date-annotator/latest/openapi.yaml

Create the file *package.json* with this content:

    {
        "name": "awesome-date-annotator",
        "version": "1.0.0",
        "license": "Apache-2.0",
        "devDependencies": {
            "@openapitools/openapi-generator-cli": "^1.0.18-4.3.1"
        },
        "scripts": {
            "test": "tox"
        }
    }

Install the dependencies listed in *package.json*

    npm install

Display help information about `openapi-generator`

    ./node_modules/.bin/openapi-generator --help

Identify the server generator that you want to use from this list

    ./node_modules/.bin/openapi-generator list

Generate the server codebase using the selected generator (here `python-flask`)

    ./node_modules/.bin/openapi-generator \
        generate -i openapi.yaml -g python-flask -o server

That's it! You can now start the Data Annotator server using the instructions
given in the section [Running using Python](#Running-with-Python).

<!-- ### Update the codebase when a new OpenAPI spec is available (TO UPDATE)

When a new API has been released there are 2 ways to update this repository
with the new specification.

The procedure in both cases starts with:

1. Look at  https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/nlp-sandbox-schemas repository.
2. Identify if a newer version of the spec has been released since the developer created his tool OR since last time he updated it.
3. Download the latest version of the spec: https://sage-bionetworks.github.io/nlp-sandbox-schemas/date-annotator/latest/openapi.yaml
4. run the command :

    npx @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli generate -i openapi.yaml -g python-flask -o server.


This will generate an output file dist.yaml in the current directory. It should output the following:

    $ npm run build openapi/date-annotator/openapi.yaml

    > nlp-sandbox-schemas@0.1.6 build ~/nlp-sandbox-schemas
    > openapi bundle -o dist $npm_config_entrypoint "openapi/date-annotator/openapi.yaml"

    bundling openapi/date-annotator/openapi.yaml...
    ðŸ“¦ Created a bundle for openapi/date-annotator/openapi.yaml at dist.yaml in 28ms.

Next to re-generate the flask app using one  of two methods.

The first is the easiest and least error prone if you are worried about overriding existing files.
One can generate a new flask app in a "test" directory and compare results between the old and new
directories . This is done with the command:

    npx @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli \
        generate -i dist.yaml -g python-flask -o server

Then compare the ~/nlp-sandbox-data-annotated-example-updated/server to your existing ~/nlp-sandbox-data-annotated-example/server directory to see
what was updated.

The other method, once you are more confident, is to lay the files on top of the existing repository you've already checked with the command:

    openapi-generator generate -i dist.yaml -g python-flask -o ~/nlp-sandbox-data-annotated-example/server

If one wants to prevent certain files you know have already been customized then add those file names
cto the ~/nlp-sandbox-data-annotated-example/server/.openapi-generator-ignore file before running the preceding command.

Then use git to see what is updated and if you overwrote any files you wanted
to preserve. One can revert those changes and add those files to the .openapi-generator-ignore file for next time there is an update. -->


### Generate a Spring Boost server stub

Generate the initial server stub from the OpenAPI specification

    mkdir server
    ./node_modules/.bin/openapi-generator-cli \
        generate -i openapi.yaml -g spring -o server

Build and start the server with Maven

    cd server
    mvn package
    java -jar target/openapi-spring-0.1.6.jar

The API documentation UI is now available at http://localhost:8080.
